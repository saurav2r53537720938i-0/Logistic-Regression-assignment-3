Precsion:Precsion measure the accuracy of postive predctions made by the model.it is the ratio true postive predctions to the total number of postive predction to the total number words,precsion answer the question out of all the instances predctied as postive how manyy are actually postive.\n",

ROC Curve: It is a plot of the true postive rate(TPR)against the false postive rate(FPR) for diffrent threshold values TPR is also known as senstvity or recall and FPR is the complemnet of specfiy pair corresponding to a particular decsion threshold .The curve shows the trade off between senstvity and specficity.\n",
